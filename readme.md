# kiritoru
I create a "kiritoru" because "kiritori" app stopped working after updating to Sierra.
It's an application that takes a screenshot of the desktop and displays it in the foreground.

# Usage
The main window is completely transparent.
Press "Command + L" to display the pointer.
Click on the upper left point on the screen where you want to take a screenshot.
Move the mouse to the lower right corner and select the area where you want to take a screenshot.
Click the mouse to bring the captured screen to the forefront.
Multiple captures are possible.

Click on the displayed capture screen to make it active, and press Enter to make the capture screen disappear.
